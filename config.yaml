    content:
     "I am a Software Engineer and Computer Engineering student currently pursuing my degree at UNAM. My main areas of interest are Distributed Systems and Machine Learning, and I am passionate about using technology to solve complex problems. During the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Meta University Intern at Meta, where I gained valuable experience working on mobile software projects. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in the field of Software Engineering.


Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy exploring the latest advancements in technology and tinkering with personal coding projects. In my free time, you can often find me playing soccer, strumming my guitar, singing, or lifting weights at the gym. I find that these hobbies provide a balance to my technical pursuits and allow me to recharge my creative batteries.


I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally. Whether it's through tackling a difficult coding problem or mastering a new song, I am dedicated to continuous improvement and pushing myself to reach new heights."
